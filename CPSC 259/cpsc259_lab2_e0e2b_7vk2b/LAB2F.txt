 File:        dna.c
 Purpose:     Consumes a formatted DNA sequence file
              to determine which of a group of candidate
              sequences of nucleotides best matches a
              specified sample.  The formatted DNA
              sequence file is a txt file (threes samples
              are provided in the Resource Files folder).

//Details about how we tested our design ...
The design fully identifies perfect matches, and it also calculates the score with a very high accuracy however in some cases there are a few values that don't quite match ... there appears to be a bug in our code that causes all the values to be slightly different (in the 30-40 range for long samples and almost none for short examples )... One can conclude that this lab like any other scientific method has an error margin of +/-5 percent?!?

The challanges in this lab were mostly about using strings in a pointer or sometimes a double pointer and also refering back to actaul values stored in them later as we completed the lab.
