1) No extra notes/information required to be told to the TA.
2) The result of the various tests from the untitests1.cpp file helped us determine the correctness of our program. If a particular unit test for a certain function was failing, it meant that the function had errors and we then tried to fix them. Other than that, we checked for bugs highlighted by the Visual Studios compiler and fixed them.
3) The fact that we were manipulating structures and using pointers as well made coding the program very challenging. Additionally, editing the code to make it pass the unit test was also a challenge. We overcame those challenges by staring at the code, trying to understand what the unit tests were testing and by testing different implementations of the same function.
4)Contribution was 50/50 for both team members.
