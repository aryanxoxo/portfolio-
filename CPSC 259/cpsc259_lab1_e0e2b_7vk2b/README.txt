This lab haunted me from the day I finished the in lab activities.  I went to the office hours, I increased the stack size to 10,000,000,
I posted on piazza and some "person" left me the most useless comment and although my code build's in VS, but when we debug it, it gives us an error
which I have already posted a picture of on Piazza.  I hope for the rest of the labs in this course we get more support both from the instructor
and also on Piazza. I personally reported the person who commented on my post as inappropriate since because of his bs answer,
 no one else looked at my question. At  this point I don't care about my mark just please let me know why does the code I submitted here not work.
Thank you very much, Aryan and Siddharth
