This lab was reletively easy to finish. The recursive function was a bit challenging but we overcame the challange! Also the path_cost function had some issues but later on using some math, the length of the cheapest path from the debugger and also the samples given to us, we found a magic number "48" which resulted in our path_cost function to calculate the correct score and give us the correct cheapest path! for more information please see the code comments! 
Me and my partner practiced pair programming over visual studio live and skype and It was really benefitial as one of us stays off campus and we can't meet most of the time! 

errors: 
some errors due to some lines that were already provided to us"green wiggly lines below malloc and calloc"
